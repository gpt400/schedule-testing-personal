### Welcome to the Shared Schedule Gap Finder!

**How to Use This App:**

1. **Login / Registration:**  
   Enter your username in the sidebar. If you are new, select your semester and click **Create Account**.

2. **Editing Your Schedule:**  
    Go to **Edit My Schedule**. For each day, you will see a calendar-like grid with rows representing hours (from 06:00 to 21:00) and four 15‑minute blocks per hour.  
    - Click individual 15‑minute blocks to mark them as **BUSY**.
    - Click the **hour toggle button** (the bold hour label) to mark or clear the entire hour at once.
    - Click **Save Schedule** to store your schedule.

3. **Comparing Schedules:**  
   Under **Compare Schedules**, select the users (grouped by semester) you want to include, then click **Find Common Gaps** to see time blocks where everyone is free or the      best one‑hour slot with minimal conflicts.

Enjoy using the app!
